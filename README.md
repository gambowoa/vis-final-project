# Pencil: A Space Odyssey

By Leann Gamboa

VIS 133 Final Project

For my final project, I decided to use my web development skills and create an interactive 3D experience in the web browser using the mechanical pencil I modeled in the beginning of this course.

I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript and relied on libraries such as Three.js for importing and rendering the 3D model, Lamina for creating the shader material for the model, and React.js for building the user interface.

The project is viewable here: [LINK](https://leann-gamboa-vis-133.vercel.app/)
